Project Name: MusicMatch

Project Description: A webapp that finds song suggestions/creates a playlist of songs
		     based on what the user enters for criteria. Tags can include genre, year or time
		     period of release, adjectives, etc.

Technology: We will be using HTML5 for our project and
	    Java will be used to write the server side
	    of our application. We will be looking into
	    API's that can help us with our project.
